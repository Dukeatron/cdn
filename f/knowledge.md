# Knowledge

> An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.

The above quote is extremely self explanatory. It means if you invest your time in knowledge, you will get paid the best interest which is money or success or self-motivation.

The children of our nation need to invest more time into **studying** and acquiring **extra knowledge**. This will enable them to gain enough knowledge to be work-ready in the 21st century and will provide them with enough skill and common sense as well.

This was a vague explanation. You can apply this quote to daily life and see the **wonderful** success.
